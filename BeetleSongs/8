[ENSEMBLE]
Latin Lyrics
Death's not great
[BETELGEUSE]
Death's far from ideal
Death has a sick way of keepin' things real
Could be lurking right there
In the next shellfish meal on your plate
[ENSEMBLE]
Death's not great
[BETELGEUSE]
No one's safe from its touch
Happens all of the time
Happens frankly, too much
Health insurance can help
Just depends on your coverage rate
[ENSEMBLE]
Death's not great
[ALL]
Ev'ry living thing dies
From the mightiest whale
To the smallest of flies
So why does it come as a massive surprisе when it's fate?
[ENSEMBLE]
Death's not grеat
[BETELGEUSE]
Death comes all at once
Or it happens in stages
Even tortoises die and those things live for ages
No matter how hard against the dying light a man rages
It's always checkmate
Death's not great
Yeah but ev'ryone does it
Although its a fact no one wants to discuss it
[BETELGEUSE AND ENSEMBLE]
It's hardly a subject you'll likely to tossup
When you're on a date
Death's not great
[ALL]
There's a dread that can fill you
For Christ's sakes, a fucking mosquito can kill you
There's so much to hate (So much to hate)
It's a waste of breath but
Death's not great
And it's just 'round the corner (Just 'round the corner)
Pounces on you like an improv performer
And when it's too late (When it's too late)
You're stuffed in a crate (Stuffed in a crate)
And all that is left (And all that is left)
Is a stack looking fit (a stack looking fit and yes)
Yes, death's not great
One little wrap 'round the farm, then it's over
Some fun in the sun, then you're pushing up clovers
We all booked that flight to eternal vacation
It's all beer and cello then "hello cremation"
One day it's all a palaver of schedules
The next you're a naked cadaver at med school
So hey, what can we say
Death's not great
It just suddenly happens
Folks dig a hole and say "ah, well that's that then"
And sell your estate (sell your estate)
It's a red-hot mess
Yes, death's not great
Your funeral's filled with fake "see-you laterers"
The corpse is ignored while they fawn on the caterers
God I'm depressed (God I'm depressed)
I think I need a rest (I need a rest)
And all that is left (And all that is left)
Is a stack of unpaid debts (your unpaid debts, yes)
Yes, death's not great
